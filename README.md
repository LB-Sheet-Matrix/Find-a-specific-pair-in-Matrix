>> Question:

Given an n x n matrix mat[n][n] of integers, find the maximum value of mat(c, d) – mat(a, b) over all choices of indexes such that both c > a and d > b.

NOTE: The program should do only ONE traversal of the matrix. i.e. expected time complexity is O(n^2)

>> Examples:

Input:
mat[N][N] = {{ 1, 2, -1, -4, -20 },
             { -8, -3, 4, 2, 1 }, 
             { 3, 8, 6, 1, 3 },
             { -4, -1, 1, 7, -6 },
             { 0, -4, 10, -5, 1 }};
Output: 18
The maximum value is 18 as mat[4][2] 
- mat[1][0] = 18 has maximum difference.
